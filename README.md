# cpu
an attempt to simulate a simple cpu on logisim 

I have always wanted to understand how a cpu really works inside. This
is an attempt to simulate one on logisim http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ 
This is still a work in progress. Someday I plan to comeback and finish 
it.

I am putting it up here so that I don't lose it. to view my design one 
needs to download logisim.
